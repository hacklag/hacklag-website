## What is HACKLAG?

HACKLAG is a **community** aiming to connect **technology enthusiasts** by organizing **creative workspaces**.

### Our Story

We strongly believe that access to the new technologies and education is necessary to improve our lives.

We want to join efforts of developers, designers, entrepreneurs, artists and everyone who are interested in new technologies. Combination of initiatives, creative people and friendly environment can result with extraordinary ideas, projects and groundbreaking solutions.
